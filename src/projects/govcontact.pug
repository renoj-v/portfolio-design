        h6 introduction
        h2 It's difficult to keep track of who your government representatives are, let alone how to contact them. However, contacting your legislator is one of the simplest and effective ways to use your political voice. UX design has a role in political activism by designing how we can communicate with government officials.

                    One of the challenges of contacting your representatives is know who they are and what they care about. Representatives can create profiles on GovContact to communicate their political stances.

                        There are many ways to message a representative. An easy way is directly through GovContact. Citizens can write messages or share video recording with their representatives.

                    We can utilize primary source information, such as social media posts from representatives, petitions, and bills to help citizens to take little actions. Even making little engagements can make huge impact.

                | Understand the steps people would currently take to contact a representative
            p.project-p.
                To hit the ground running, I arranged a focus group to receive a large amount of qualitative insights in a short amount of time.
                Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
                Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences.

            p.project-p.
                There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
                A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.

            p.project-p.
                To tackle the problem from all angles, I contacted my own reps. I called their offices and conducted surveys on how a citizen could best get their voice heard.
                It was helpful to understand what happens to a citizen's message.

                To understand civic engagement on a broader scale, I looked online for previous research. A few studies, surveys, and articles revealed some new insights as well as why this problem was worth solving. 
                Sources included The Annenberg Public Policy Center, Pew Research Center, Congress Management Foundation, The Boston Globe, and GlobalCitizen.org.

            //-         77% of representatives said they preferred email as the primary communication over every other option. The main reason? Emails are optimal for archiving requirements. In addition, many officials noted that they can easily forward or cc staff members who can assist. Emails also allow time for a well written and researched response.
