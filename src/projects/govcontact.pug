However, contacting your legislator is one of the simplest and effective ways to use your political voice. UX design has a role in political activism by designing how we can communicate with government officials.

                    One of the challenges of contacting your representatives is know who they are and what they care about. Representatives can create profiles on GovContact to communicate their political stances.

                        There are many ways to message a representative. An easy way is directly through GovContact. Citizens can write messages or share video recording with their representatives.

                    We can utilize primary source information, such as social media posts from representatives, petitions, and bills to help citizens to take little actions. Even making little engagements can make huge impact.
