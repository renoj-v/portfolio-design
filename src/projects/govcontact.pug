                One of the challenges of contacting your representatives is know who they are and what they care about. Representatives can create profiles on GovContact to communicate their political stances.

                To hit the ground running, I arranged a focus group to receive a large amount of qualitative insights in a short amount of time.
                Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
                Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences.

                There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
                A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.

                To tackle the problem from all angles, I contacted my own reps. I called their offices and conducted surveys on how a citizen could best get their voice heard.
                It was helpful to understand what happens to a citizen's message.

                To understand civic engagement on a broader scale, I looked online for previous research. A few studies, surveys, and articles revealed some new insights as well as why this problem was worth solving. 
                Sources included The Annenberg Public Policy Center, Pew Research Center, Congress Management Foundation, The Boston Globe, and GlobalCitizen.org.

                To summarize all my research efforts, I made personas that represented the people I wanted to design for. 
                To boil down the requirements to tackle into individual chunks, I created user story cards to refer to throughout the design process

            p.project-p.
                There were 3 iterations of design and testing to get towards the final solution. Testing consisted of citizens using the prototype in an interview format. At each stage, I incorporated feedback from users and mentors. Here's a brief overview of some the stages

                        Users needed more information about a rep's political stance than party affiliation.
                        Also started with a layer of a classic "red, white, and blue" visual design.

                        After testing the second prototype and receiving feedback from mentors, I learned that the information was too tightly packed. 
                        For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.

                    p.project-p.
                        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
                        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.

            Briana could stay updated with her representatives, message representatives immediately, and share GovContact with her advocacy group.
