        h2 Contacting your legislator is one of the simplest and effective ways to use your political voice. The goal of GovContact is to put that power at a citizen's fingertips. UX design has a role in political activism by designing how we can communicate with government officials.

                To hit the ground running, I arranged a focus group to receive a large amount of qualitative insights in a short amount of time.
                Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
                Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences.

                There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
                A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.

                To tackle the problem from all angles, I contacted my own reps. I called their offices and conducted surveys on how a citizen could best get their voice heard.
                It was helpful to understand what happens to a citizen's message.

            p.project-p.
                To understand civic engagement on a broader scale, I looked online for previous research. A few studies, surveys, and articles revealed some new insights as well as why this problem was worth solving. 
                Sources included The Annenberg Public Policy Center, Pew Research Center, Congress Management Foundation, The Boston Globe, and GlobalCitizen.org.

                        The initial step was to come with different ways of showcasing a representative. For the first prototype, experiments focused on what type of contact information would be important. I chose a card style interface at first to allow users to quickly scan multiple reps

                        Building upon wireframes, I added a layer of visual design that focused on the red, white, and blue that appears in many political campaigns.
                        After conducting user tests, I found that citizens needed more information about a representative than just their party affiliation and contact information.

                        Incorporating the insights from user testing, I went towards a profile feature that representatives could fill out to connect with citizens.
                        This information could also be scraped from their social media or bills that they have written. This information would be more helpful in understanding a representative than their political party affiliation.

                        After testing the second prototype and receiving feedback from mentors, I learned that the information was too tightly packed. 
                        For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.

                        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
                        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.

            Both need to learn where their representatives stand on the issues. Terry could directly message his state representatives voting on the free tuition bill. 
            Briana could stay updated with her representatives, message representatives immediately, and share GovContact with her advocacy group.
