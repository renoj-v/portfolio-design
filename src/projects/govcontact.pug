                How we engage in politics could use some improvement. 
                Conversations between citizens happen over social media, but there should more communication with legistators: those who have the immediate power to make effective change.
                As part of a class project, I decided to tackle this specific problem by designing an app that helps citizens contact their representatives more often.
                UX design can play a role in political activisim by ideating the technology to help us better communicate.
            +role("UX Researcher & UX/UI Designer")

            span.
              The initial focus group was composed of my classmates, all of whom were at or above voting age. 
              I presented my idea in class to hear some of the questions and frustrations a citizen might have. 
              We talked about how most only knew who their Congressmen and Governor were. 
              If one of my classmates were to contact a representative, they would use a search engine to find a representatives social media or email address. 
              This research was a good primer to think about how a citizen would need contact information for all their representatives at the federal, state, and local levels. 
            +subheader("Competitive Analysis")
            span.
              There are many applications (mobile and web) that can find U.S. governmental offcials.
              My methodology for research was to understand their user experience and see what could be improved. 
              Part of this research was to also read the reviews of these apps (the good, the bad, and the odd). 
              The research spanned government, non-profit, and commercial organizations.

            +subheader("Contacting my own Representatives")
            span.
              The best way to understand the process of contacting a government representative is to contact a government representative. 
              I called 5 representatives' offices to interview someone working there.
              I learned that it is usually an intern or staff member that receives the call/email/letter. The message is usually recorded as part of a tally or redirected to the proper office.
              A caller can receive immediate feedback over the phone. An email or letter will usually receive a templated response. 
              Understanding this process helped me make key design decisions in the future.

              The culminating result of the previous research: the personas to empathize with during the design process.
              I tackled the problem from two perspectives. One is Briana Jackson, a nurse who 
              Another perspective is Terry Mendoza, who would use the app for a limited time to tell his story to his legislators.

                | Some apps show only Congressmen. Some show only state legislators. 
                | For GovContact, it is important to show representatives at every level: federal, state, local.
                | Local officials can have just a large an impact on daily life as a Senator. All reps should be available to a citizen.
              +listItem("Finding contact info can take some time")
                | Many applications I found are bogged down with account creation and email registration. These are a barrier that might prevent citizens from contacting their reps.
              +listItem("Political neutrality is important")
                | From the focus group and reading user reviews of current apps, citizens would care about political neutrality in an app.
                | It wouldn't be fair to be bias towards a political party. On the same logic, the app shouldn't push specific issues or include advertisements.
              //- +listItem("Citizens are likely to not know who their representatives are")
                | Based on the focus group and online research, we cannot expect citizens to know who all their representatives are. People might be able to idenitfy their Congressmen or Governor. But it is less likely people will know who occupies smaller offices.
              +listItem("Frequency is the key to getting through")
                | From the conversations with representatives' offices, it seemed that citizens need to contact their representatives frequently to be effective.
                | A call or email may take 5 minutes. If this action were taken by many people at the same time, government officials would have to listen.
                | GovContact should be that app that help citizens take this action to make effective change.
            
        +section("Initial Idea: Web App")
        .project-p.
            The first idea was to create GovContact as a web application. It would be accessible to anyone with internet access.
            There would be no app to download. And it can provide up-to-date information on a consistent basis. Briana and Terry could use a simple link to have access to their representatives when they needed to make their voices heard.
            
            
        +section("User Stories")
            span.project-p.
                The following user stories represent what GovContact is able to do.
                Writing user stories helped me think inside the shoes of someone who might use this app.
                I considered how Terry could find the names of the state legislators making a decision on a free tuition bill.
                Briana should be able to use GovContact to find channels to communicate with a politician directly, such as through phone, email or social media.

            +subheader("Deciding What Contact Information To Have")
            span.project-p.
                One of the main challenges of this app is to decide which forms of contact to provide to citizens.
                Every Government representative has a phone line and email, and most officials utilize social media. 
                Representatives also have websites as well.
                People can also send in hand letters to a physical address. There's also the question of showcasing the political party which each official belongs to.
                With so many options it was difficult to choose what contact info to show.
                
                Examples of my information experiments can be found below
            +img("govcontact_wireframes-cards.png", "wireframes")
            +subheader("Final Wireframes")
            span.project-p.
                The final decision for contact info was to include a phone number, an email address, and links to at least Twitter and Facebook.
                The online research on the efficacy as well as the digital availability and convenience supported my decision. 
                Interviews with represenatives' offices showed that phone and emails were also the most effective forms of contact.
            span.project-p.
                To keep it simple, the web app is a search screen, similar to Google or another search engine. 
                The query is to type in a home address, which is the most accurate key to find a person's representatives.
            +img("govcontact_wireframes.jpg", "wireframes")
        +section("Styles and Icons")
            span.project-p.
                The colors and icons for the app. I went with the classic red, white, and blue, 
                since I was focusing on government representatives in the U.S.A. 
                To convey the governmental nature of the app, graphics were designed around stars, flags, and government buildings.
                The colors helped accent this tone. 
                Color was also important to indicate political party.
                Democrats would be given a blue icon, republicans would given a red icon, an independents/moderates/unknown party would not given an icon.
                The fonts Lato and Roboto offered strong readability. Varying fonts better highlighted information (e.g. Lato Bold for a representative's name)

        +section("Prototyping")
            +subheader("Code Prototypes are GREAT, but also time-consuming")
            span.
              The first prototype was created using React.js and Google Civic API. It was a great way to combine my programming skills with my design skills.
              Having something fully interactable (compared to click-through prototypes) was helpful during user testing. There was greater insight into how someone would use GovContact in the wild.
              However, a lot of time was invested in programming that could have been dedicated to reviewing design decisions or organizing a user study.
              In the end, it was worth the investment, and I also better understand when a code prototype is needed. 
            +subheader("Link & Screenshots to Prototype")
            span.
                 Here are screenshots of the 
                first prototype. It can also be found by clicking 
            a.link(href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com")

            +subheader("First Screen: Search Bar")
            span.
              The first screen of the web app is for the user to search for the representatives, by address.
              It starts with header, with a description of GovContact and a hero image to display brand.
              The only interactable item is the search box to input an address.
            +img("final-result.png", "final")
            +subheader("Second Screen: All the Reps")
            span.
              The second half of the app is to display all the representatives' information in a card format, which was decided upon in the wireframe stage.
              Every representative is required to have atleast an email and phone number. A Twitter or Facebook handle will also be displayed.
            +img("final-result2.png", "final") 
        +section("User Testing")
            span.project-p.
                The web app was tested with 5 participants in an informal interview setting. Each participant explored the site on their own and was asked follow up questions.
                Testing the app revealed: 
            +list()
              +listItem("Filtering and Sorting Options")
                | Most participants spent a lot of time scrolling to learn about representatives. Every participant had some diffculty when asked to find a specific representative
                | A sorting or filtering option would help solve this usability issue.
              //- +listItem("Increase text size of links")
                | Another common usuability issue was that participants had trouble finding and hovering over links to contact information e.g. a Twitter handle. The root of the problem was the text size, as people tended to squint when hovering over a link. 
              +listItem("Web may not be right platform")
                | Most participants they were more likely to use a search engine if they were already on a browser. As a website, GovContact may not provide as much value.

            //-add specific features
        +section("Turn to a Mobile App")
            span.
              To provide better value, GovContact should be a mobile app. There wouldn't be any link to follow. 
              By taking up visual space inside a phone, the app would also serve as a reminder to a citizen.
              A mobile would also allow a person to call a representative directly from their phone.
        +section("Style Update")
            span.
              After user testing, I decided to update the brand of GovContact.
              Instead of contrasting, polarized colors of red and blue, the primary color is a purple, the unity of the former.
              To convey the feeling of government, I used photographs of building and monuments.

            +subheader("2-step Onboarding")
            span.
              GovContact doesn't require anyone to create an account or provide an email.
              The only required information is a physical address that can be used to find the correpsonding reps.

              Each of the three levels of government has a different impact on a citizens life, so each represenative is chunked into their proper group.
              Finding a rep is the same process as finding a contact in Messenger or Whatsapp.
              I borrowed the familiar layout such that Briana or Terry could use GovContact as they would any other messaging app.

            span.
              Based on the online research and interviews with government employees, the contact information for each rep is ordered by availability and effectiveness.
              Although no political party is mentioned, Briana and Terry can understand how each of their reps stands on the issues.

            span.
              I created a user flow to illustrate how each screen connects to one another. 
              It was important to consider all the default and error states a user might encounter.

              The final step in the solution was to create a click-through prototype.
              Time was a little short and there were no complex interactions, so a click-through prototype was more appropriate. 
              An embed of the prototype can be found below.

            GovContact is an app to connect citizens to their representatives. 
            The process involved research, interviewing users, wireframing, branding, prototyping, and user testing.
            The final solution was a mobile app in which citizens could learn about their representatives and contact them quickly.
          +subheader("Future Steps")
          span.
            The next steps for the app would be to test the click-through prototype with real users.
            The purpose of the usability test is to identify the UX problems that ought to be fixed before development
            Afterwards, and iOS and Anroid app can be programmed and deployed to their respective stores.

                    The main piece of feedback I received was to keep the application simple as possible for someone to learn about their representatives.
                    This meant leaving out any signup forms, providing a simple set of set of instructions, and mapping the fewest number of steps to lead people to contact their representative.

                  There are many applications (mobile and web) that can find U.S. governmental offcials.
                  My methodology for research was to understand their user experience and see what could be improved. 
                  The research spanned government, non-profit, and commercial organizations. 
                  I conducted a competitive analysis, looking at where this app could make an impact.
                  Here are some of my insights that I wanted to bring to GovContact:
                +list()
                  +listItem("Do not focus on specific issues")
                      | A couple of the applications were focused on highlighting specific issues.
                      | Though it encouraged people to contact their representatives, this app should be more neutral
                  +listItem("No requirement for creating an account or signing up by email")
                      | One aspect that GovContact should avoid is trying to get citizens to sign up for an app.
                      | The onboarding process should be as quick as possible and limited to entering a physical address
                  +listItem("Keep it Simple")
                      | For this app, I wanted to create a tool people could quickly and simply reach their representatives.
                      | Something that would be 
                  +img("govcontact_analysis.jpg", "wireframes", "Part of the matrix for my competitive analysis.")
            //- add screenshots of various apps that drew inspiration
            +subheader("Personas")
                span.project-p.
                    Personas helped me think about user needs and how someone might use GovContact.
                    I tackled the problem from two perspectives. One is Briana Jackson, who could use GovContact on a regular basis when she wants to talk to a politician or give a supporter a way to find their representative.
                    Another perspective is Terry Mendoza, who would use the app for a limited time to tell his story to his legislators.

                +img("persona_terry.png", "Persona Terry Mendoza")
        +section("User Stories")
            span.project-p.
                The following user stories represent what GovContact is able to do.
                Writing user stories helped me think inside the shoes of someone who might use this app.
                I considered how Terry could find the names of the state legislators making a decision on a free tuition bill.
                Briana should be able to use GovContact to find channels to communicate with a politician directly, such as through phone, email or social media. 
            +img("govcontact_user-stories.jpg", "user stories")
        +section("Wireframes")
            //-- explain process of what info to put on card
            //-- place graph from that website
            //-- explain how we chose four contact ways
            +subheader("Deciding What Contact Information To Have")
            span.project-p.
                One of the main challenges of this app is to decide which forms of contact to provide to citizens.
                Every Government representative has a phone line and email, and a strong majority of officials utilize social media. 
                Representatives also have websites as well.
                People can also send in hand letters to a physical address. There's also the question of showcasing the political party which each official belongs to.
                With so many options it was difficult to choose what contact info to show.
                
                Examples of my information experiments can be found below
              
            +img("govcontact_wireframes-cards.png", "wireframes")
            span.project-p.
                To make a final decision, I considered solving the problem by balancing:
            +list()
                +listItem("What is most accessible to someone using this app")
                    | Considering the web platform, it is easy to assume that someone has internet connection and is on their laptop/phone.
                    | Briana and Terry would both need contact information that they could immediately use
                    | The fastest ways to contact a representative would be through email, social media, and a phone call.
                +listItem("What are the most effective ways to contact a representative")
                    | For this portion, I conducted some online research to learn what contact methods are most influentional.
                    | From an 
                    a(href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/heres-why-you-should-call-not-email-your-legislators.html")
                      | article 
                    | by Daniel, it seemed that phone calls were effective to contact a representative directly or atleast their office.
                    | It was also considered to be more effective in state and local governments. This is particuraly important for Terry, who trying to get a state law to pass, and Briana who hopes the law will support her local community. 
                    | According to a 
                    a(href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2017/10/03/whats-the-best-way-to-contact-your-representatives/")
                      | study 
                    |  done by Azavea where 1000 government officials were surveyed,
                    | the top 3 forms of contact were email (77% approved), social media (13%), and phone (11%)
                    | With email with such strong approval and accessiblity, an email address should be provided.
                    | Alongside email, there should be some social media handles. Based on a 
                    a(href="https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/congress-social-media-2018/412/")
                      | survey on social media 
                    | done by a site called Quorum, it seemed that politicians were most active on Facebook and Twitter. 
      
            +subheader("Final Wireframes")
            span.project-p.
                The final decision for contact info was to include a phone number, an email address, and links to at least Twitter and Facebook.
                
            span.project-p.
                To keep it as simple, the web app is a search screen, similar to Google or another search engine. 
                The query is to type in a home address, which is the most accurate key to find a person's representatives.
            +img("govcontact_wireframes.jpg", "wireframes")
        +section("Styles and Icons")
            span.project-p.
                The colors and icons for the app. I went with the classic red, white, and blue, 
                since I was focusing on government representatives in the U.S.A. 
                To convey the governmental nature of the app, graphics were designed around stars, flags, and government buildings.
                The colors helped accent this tone. 
                Color was also important to indicate political party.
                Democrats would be given a blue icon, republicans would given a red icon, an independents/moderates/unknown party would not given an icon.
                The fonts Lato and Roboto offered strong readability. Varying fonts better highlighted information (e.g. Lato Bold for a representative's name)
            +img("style-guide.png", "styles").white-bg
        +section("Feedback")
            span.
                The first prototype was created using React.js and Google Civic API. Here are screenshots of the 
                first prototype. It can also be found by clicking 
            a.link(href="https://gov-contact.herokuapp.com")
                | here. 
            span.project-p.
                Testing the app revealed that:
            +list()
              +listItem("Less red, white and blue")
                  | Users tended to prefer a more neutral color palette. The app could be expanded to other countries than the U.S. The use of red and blue may have conveyed the feeling of political parties more than government itself. 
                  | As a designer, it's tough to hear that colors don't work well. But maybe there's a better way to give the right feel for GovContact.
              //- differentiate federal vs state vs local  
              +listItem("Possibly find user's location automatically")
                  | Though it was never mentioned, a later thought was to be able to track a user's location through their browser.
                  | It would eliminate any steps a person would need to take to find a government official
              +listItem("Would likely not be used on a website")
                  | Almost every interviewee said they would be unlikely to go onto the site when they wanted to talk to their represenative.  
                  | They were more likely to use a search engine instead. 
              +listItem("Would be better as a mobile app")
                  | One user commented how GovContact would be better as a mobile app. It would be like having your senator as one of your personal contacts.
                  | Even though this was only one user's input, the feedback hinted on the other users' needs. It is easy to forget a link or use a search engine instead.
                  | But as a mobile app, GovContact is given greater weight and semblance inside a user's phone.

                Taking this feedback, I made a second prototype as a mobile app. A lesson I learned was that code prototypes take a long time.
                This prototype was done in Invision and can be found
