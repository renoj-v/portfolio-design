                Personas and Journey Maps helped summarize my research results to the Subconscious organization. With these, I was able to have a conversation with organization leaders on how we could better introduce Subconscious to new readers.
                The documents guided my designs as I thought about how I could improve Jamie's and Tara's experiences on the Subconscious website.
