                The idea of the project came from what could be possible with projection mapping technology. 
                I wanted to prototype a new type of store display, in which mannequins could showcase multiple 
                styles. The concept evolved to show what could be done by integrating technology into clothing.
                For example, consider how somone could change the color and style of their shirt by just swiping their
                fingers across their chest. You can find my prototypes below.

                The mapping process involved tracing over the project to find the shape of the mannequin and its features.
                Afterwards, I used After Effects to animate a video that showcased different styles of sunglasses. Below is
                an example of the mask and animation in After Effects.

            span.
                The first test run, videoed below, is the result of projecting my animation on to a mannequin mannequin head. The animation changes
                the colors of hair, eyebrows, lipstick, and sunglasses to show the potential for accessory store displays.

            span.
                For the final show, I used a full-mannequin for the display. I took it as opportunity to see what can be done with technology embedded in clothing
                Clothing could be animated graphics, might biometric data, and switch styles within seconds. My projection was presented at my school's open house. Prospective students and their families came
                to see this performance.
