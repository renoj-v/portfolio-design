                        For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.

                        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
                        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.

                    p.project-p This was one of the most research-heavy projects I encountered. Civic engagement is a complicated issue that I had to learn about before I could start designing for it. 
                        | The most effective forms of research were the focus group and government employee interviews. Talking to real people helped me develop a greater sense of empathy of what people needed in a civic engagment app.

                    p.project-p To develop a richer visual language, I started the process early. The goal was to make each design choice have a meaning, which would require a longer period of time to develop.

                    h5 Compare Reps Across Issues
                    p.project-p Instead of learning about representatives individually, an interesting feature would be to compare all your representative stances based on a political issue. This could be a tabular design that allowed a citizen to quickly know how all of their representatives stood on a single issue. 
             
                    h5 Message History
                    p.project-p One the features that would be needed is an inbox feature that citizens could use to keep track of where their messages ended up and if they received a response. Currently GovContact would send an email to citizens that they could continue further correspondence.
